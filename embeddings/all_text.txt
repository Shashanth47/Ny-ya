2. Definitions
3. Prohibition of absorption into State Civil Service
4. Act to override other laws
5. Power to remove difficulties
STATEMENT OF OBJECTS AND REASONS
ACT 35 OF 2020.- The Hon’ble High Court of Karnataka in
W.P.No.28000/2003 and in connected cases has directed the State Government for
absorption of employees of Public Sector Enterprises, who were working on
deputation into the Government departments.
In the above circumstances, the State Government was under obligation for
absorption of the petitioners who were the employees of Public Sector Enterprises
into the different departments of the State Government and Municipal Councils.
The establishments in public sector face closures due to various reasons and
the Employees of such establishment in Public Sector tend to demand that their
services be absorbed against posts in the Civil Services of the State and approach
courts seeking absorption in their services.
The rules regulating the recruitment and conditions of service and the scales
of pay applicable to Government Servants are different from those applicable to the
employees of establishments in public sector and are often irreconcilable. Such
absorption of the employees of establishment in Public Sector would result in an
enormous drain on the finances of the State, seriously affecting the developmental
programmes of this State and hence, it is against public interest.
In order to prevent absorption of the employees of Public Sector Enterprises
into the State Civil Services, it is considered necessary to enact the Karnataka State
Civil Services (Prohibition of Absorption of the Services of the employees of
establishments in Public Sector into Public Service) Bill, 2020.
Hence, the Bill.

SCHEDULE
STATEMENT OF OBJECTS AND REASONS
I
Act 14 of 1990.- Articles 309, 187 (2) and 229(2) of the Constitution of India
provide for the recruitment and conditions of service of civil servants being regulated by
law of the State Legislature. It is therefore considered desirable to make a law for this
purpose.
Since rules regulating the recruitment and conditions of service made under the
Act relate to civil servants, the secretarial staff of the Karnataka State Legislature and
conditions of service of the members of the establishment of the High Court, provision
has been made in clause 3(2) for the previous publication of the rules and for
ascertaining the views of the Presiding Officers of the Legislature and of the High Court
before the rules are made.
Provision has been made in clause 3 for continuance of the rules made before
the commencement of the Act. The Vigilance Commissioner, the officers of the Vigilance
Commission and other officers who may be required to conduct inquires into the conduct
of civil servants will have to be invested with necessary powers to enable them to
conduct the inquires properly. For this purpose, it is proposed to take power to invest
such officers with certain powers of a civil court while trying a suit under the Code of Civil
Procedure, 1908. In order to deal with corrupt civil servants in possession of assets
disproportionate to their known sources of income for which they cannot satisfactorily
account, it is considered necessary to have provision for presuming misconduct when it
is proved that a civil servant is in possession of disproportionate assets. Provisions for
said matters have been made in clause 5 of the Bill.
( Published in Karnataka Gezette (Ex-ordinary) Part !V-2A dated 10.8.1978 as
No 1135 at page 10.)

II
Amending Act 37 of 1991.- Keeping in view, the Independent Status of the
Legislature and the High Court, it is considered necessary to amend the Karnataka State
Civil Services Act, 1978. (Karnataka Act No.14 of 1990) suitably to confer on the
Legislature and the High Court, the power of controlling their Staff as well as to enforce
the compulsory reservation policy in the said services.
Opportunity is also utilised to make certain consequential amendments.
Hence the Bill.
(Published in Karnataka Gazettee (Extraordinary) Part IV-2A dated 30.9.1991 as
No.621.)
II
Amending Act 17 of 2003.- It is considered necessary to reduce the period of
30 days specified in clause (a) of sub-section (2) of section 3 of the Karnataka State Civil
Services Act, 1978 to 15 days in order to enable more expeditious completion of the
process of making rules.
Hence the Bill.
[LA BILL No. 31 of 2002]
[Entry 41 of List-II of Seventh Schedule to the Constitution of India]
III
Amending Act 20 of 2010.- It is considered necessary to amend the Karnataka
State Civil Services Act, 1978, to dispense with the requirement of previous publication
of rules specifying only the number and nature of the posts created; and to replace the
reference to the Prevention of Corruption Act, 1947, in the explanation below sub-
section (3) of section 5, with that of the Prevention of Corruption Act, 1988 (Central Act
No.49 of 1988) which repealed the old Act.
Hence the Bill.

SCHEDULE
STATEMENT OF OBJECTS AND REASONS
Act 21 of 2018.- It is considered necessary to provide for Consequential
Seniority of the Government Servants promoted on the basis of Reservation to the
posts in the Civil Services of the State with the effect from the 27th day of April 1978
in pursuance of Article 16 (4A) of the Constitution of India in the following
circumstances, namely:-
The Government of Karnataka has introduced the policy of reservation in
promotion in favour of the Government Servants belonging to the Scheduled Castes
and the Scheduled Tribes as per the Government Order No. DPAR 29 SBC 77 dated
27.4.1978;
Paragraph 7 of the Reservation Order stipulates that the inter-se seniority
amongst persons promoted in accordance with that order on any occasion has to be
determined, in the manner provided in rule 4 or 4-A, as the case may be, of the
Karnataka Government Servants (Seniority) Rules, 1957;
The Supreme Court of India, in its Judgment dated 1 -12-2000, in the case of
M.G. Badappanavar and Another Versus State of Karnataka and others in Civil
Appeal Nos. 6970-6971 of 2000 with Civil Appeal No. 6972 of 2000 (AIR 2001 SC
260) while dealing with the issue of determination of seniority interse between the
persons belonging to the reserved categories and the general category, in pursuance
of the ratio of the decision of the Constitution Bench in Ajit Singh and Others (II) Vs
State of Punjab and others-(1999) 7 SCC 209 has examined rule 2(c), rule 4 and
rule 4-A of the Karnataka Government Servants’ (Seniority) Rules, 1957 and has
observed that there is no specific rule therein permitting seniority to be counted in
respect of a person promoted against a (reserved) roster point;
Subsequently, the Parliament has enacted the Constitution (Eighty Fifth
Amendment) Act, 2001 by insertion of clause (4A) to Article 16 of the Constitution
2
with retrospective effect from 17-6-1995 providing for consequential seniority in the
case of promotion on the basis of reservation;
The Government of Karnataka has enacted the Karnataka Determination of
Seniority of the Government Servants promoted on the basis of reservation (to the
posts in the civil services of the State) Act, 2002 (Karnataka Act 10 of 2002) (herein
after referred to as Karnataka Act 10 of 2002) to remove any ambiguity and to
clarify that the Government Servants belonging to the Scheduled Castes and the
Scheduled Tribes promoted in accordance with the policy of reservation in
promotion contained in the Reservation Order shall be entitled to seniority as it is
available to the Government Servants belonging to the other categories;
The validity of the Karnataka Act 10 of 2002 and constitutional amendments
to Articles 16(4A) and 16(4B) came to be challenged in Supreme court in Sri.M.
Nagaraj & others in W.P.No 61/2002. The Hon’ble Supreme Court in the said case
upheld the constitutional validity of Articles 16(4A) and 16(4B) and held that the
validity of the individual enactments of the appropriate States shall be gone into in
individual Writ petitions by the appropriate Bench. In turn having been remitted,
the High Court of Karnataka in W.P.No.14655/2010 has examined the
constitutional validity of Karnataka Act 10 of 2002 and declared that the same was
a valid piece of legislation as it satisfied the tests specified by the Supreme Court in
M.Nagaraja’s case. The correctness of the view taken by the High Court of
Karnataka was then assailed in Appeal before the Supreme Court in B.K.Pavitra
case;
The Hon'ble Supreme Court of India in its judgment dated: 09.02.2017 in
the case of B.K. Pavitra and others v/s Union of India and others in Civil Appeal No.
2368 of 2011 and connected matters while dealing with the issue of consequential
seniority provided to the Scheduled Castes and the Scheduled Tribes, having regard
to the ratio of the decision of the Constitution Bench in M. Nagaraj in Writ Petition
No. 61 of 2002 has observed that a proper exercise for determining ‘inadequacy of
representation’, ‘backwardness’ and ‘overall efficiency’, is a must for exercise of
power under Article 16(4A). The court held that in the absence of this exercise
under Article 16(4A) it is the “catch up” rule that shall be applicable. Having
observed this the Court declared the provisions of Sections 3 and 4 of the
Karnataka Act 10 of 2002 to be ultra vires of Article 14 and 16 of the Constitution.
The Hon'ble Supreme Court directed that revision of the Seniority lists be
undertaken and completed within three months and further consequential action
be taken within the next three months;
In order to comply with the directions of the Hon'ble Supreme Court in B.K.
Pavitra and others v/s Union of India and others in Civil Appeal No. 2368 of 2011
the Government has issued order vide Government order No: DPAR 182 SRR 2011
dated 06.05.2017 to all appointing authorities to revise the seniority lists;
While in compliance of the Supreme Court order, the Government considering
the need and taking note of the decision of the Constitution Bench in M. Nagaraj, in
Writ Petition No. 61 of 2002, has entrusted the task of conducting study and
submitting a report on the backwardness of Scheduled Castes and Scheduled
Tribes in the State, inadequacy of their representation in the State Civil Services
and the effect of reservation in promotion on the State administration, to the
Additional Chief Secretary to Government in Government Order No. DPAR 182 SRR
2011 dated: 22.03.2017;
3
The Additional Chief Secretary to Government with the assistance of officers
from various departments has collated the scientific, quantifiable and relevant data
collected and having made a detailed study of quantifiable data has submitted a
report on the backwardness of Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes in the State,
inadequacy of their representation in the State Civil Services and the effect of
reservation in promotion on the State administration to the State Government;
The report confirms the backwardness of Scheduled Castes and Scheduled
Tribes in the State, inadequacy of their representation in the State Civil Services
and that the overall efficiency of administration has not been affected or hampered
by extending reservation in promotion to the Scheduled Castes and Scheduled
Tribes in the State and continuance of reservation in promotion within the limits
will not affect or hamper overall efficiency of administration;
The Government of Karnataka has also obtained the views of Legal Experts
and the Karnataka Law Commission in this regard; and
After having examined the report submitted by the Additional Chief Secretary
and the views expressed by the Legal Experts, the Government of Karnataka has
accepted the report. Keeping in view the findings of the report, the Government is
satisfied and having identified and measured, has come to the conclusion that
compelling reasons continue to exist for providing consequential seniority to
persons promoted on the basis of policy of reservation in the State since 1978 so as
to ensure adequate representation of the Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes
across all departments;
Hence, the Bill.

Scheduled Tribes across all departments;
Now therefore, State on finding of compelling necessity for exercise of its
powers, it is of the opinion that, it is expedient to provide for the following and for
the matters connected therewith and incidental thereto;
Be it enacted by the Karnataka State Legislature in the sixty eighth year of
the Republic of India, as follows:-
1. Short title and commencement.- (1) This Act may be called the
Karnataka Extension of Consequential Seniority to Government Servants Promoted

temporarily placed at the disposal of the Government of India, the Government of
another State, a local authority, any person or persons whether incorporated or

service in a cadre:
Provided that the seniority inter-se of the Government Servants belonging to

calculated in respect of each of those lower cadres:
Provided also that the serial numbers of the roster points specified in the
Reservation Order are intended only to facilitate calculation of the number of
vacancies reserved for promotion at a time and such roster points are not intended
to determine inter-se seniority of the Government Servants belonging to the
Scheduled Castes and the Scheduled Tribes vis-a-vis the Government Servants
belonging to the unreserved category promoted at the same time and such inter-se
seniority shall be determined by their seniority inter-se in the cadre from which
they are promoted, as illustrated in the Schedule appended to this Act.
4. Protection of consequential seniority already accorded from 27th
April 1978 onwards.- Notwithstanding anything contained in this Act or any other
law for the time being in force, the consequential seniority already accorded to the
Government servants belonging to the Scheduled Castes and the Scheduled Tribes

provided for in the Reservation Order with effect from the Twenty Seventh Day of
April, Nineteen Hundred and Seventy Eight shall be valid and shall be protected
and shall not be disturbed.
5. Provision for review.- All promotions to the posts belonging to the State

the session or the successive sessions aforesaid, both Houses agree in making any
modification in the rule or both Houses agree that the rule should not be made the
rule shall thereafter have effect only in such modified form or be of no effect, as the
case may be, so however that any such modification or annulment shall be without
prejudice to the validity of anything previously done under that rule.

the provisions of this Act, the Government may by order published in the official

THE KARNATAkA STATE SERVANTS (DETERMINATION OF AGE)ACT,1974
ARRAGEMENT OFSECTIONS
Statement of Object and Reasons
Sections:
1. Short title.
2. Definition.
3. Determination of age entry into State Services.
4. Bar of alteration of age except under the Act.
5. Alteration of age date of birth of State Servants.
6. Bar of jurisdiction of courts.
Summary of Amendments
STATEMENT OF OBJECTIONS AND REASONS
I
Act 22 of 1974.- At present the provisions contained in article 404 of the Karnataka
Financial Code prescribe the procedure for determination of date of birth with reference to
certain documents like an authenticated extract from the birth or the baptismal register, S.S.L.C.
certificate, affidavits, etc.
Although the provisions of the Karnataka Financial Code have been issued under the
Constitution of India, they do not have the effect of excluding civil courts from determining the
date of birth for purposes of ascertaining the date of superannuation of Government servants.
This has enabled Government servants to institute suits some time before the date of
superannuation for determining the date of birth, which in many cases is different from the one
determined under article 404 of the Karnataka Financial code.
Determination of age, for service purposes will have to be done by Government taking
into consideration all the relevant material. It is therefore considered necessary to taking into
consideration all the relevant material. It is therefore considered necessary to vest the power in
the Government and in the case of Government servants who are subject to the control of the
High court under article 235 of the Constitution of Indian in the High Court and exclude the
jurisdiction of courts in the matter.
Hence the Bill.
(Published in the Karnataka Gazette(Extraordinary)Part IV-2A No.-308,dated28-3-
1973,at page6.)
II
Amending Act 22 of 1977.-The Karnataka State Servants(Determination of
Age),Act,1974 bars the jurisdiction of courts in the matter of the determination of age and date of
birth of Government servants. But in certain cases, persons have obtained declarations regarding
their age courts before they entered Government service and produced them as evidence of their
date of birth and age after entering Government service. It is not desirable to accept such
declarations without verification as the decisions in these cases would not be after an effective
contest, interests of Government not being affected as the plaintiff was not a Government
servant.
In such cases even though Government might have been a party in each of the suits they
would not have been effectively contested as the interests of Government were not directly
involved.
2
In is therefore, proposed to amend the Act to make it clear that decree obtained by a
person before he entered Government service shall not be binding on Government and that the
age and date of birth of such a person shall also be determined in accordance with the Act after
the person enters Government service.
(Published in the Karnataka Gazette (Extraordinary) Part IV-2A No.-534, dated 8-7-
1977, at page 3.)
III
Amending Act 22 of 1982.- Section 3 of the Karnataka State Servants (Determination of
Age) Act, 1974, prescribes the procedure to be followed by the concerned appointing authority in
determining and accepting the age and date of birth of a person on his entry into State service.
Determination of age and acceptance of date of birth of the State Servant has to be considered
and decided by the appointing authority on the basis of various documents, such as extract from
birth of baptismal register, original horoscope or correspondence contemporaneous with the time
and date of birth, entries in school and college records, etc.
2. The procedure required to be followed is elaborate. Apart from the possibility of abuse
of this provision this has also led to large number of applications under section 5 for alteration of
the date of birth on the ground that the age of the applicant has not been determined in
accordance with the provisions of the Act. It is, therefore, proposed to amend section 3 of the
Act to provide that in the case of persons who have passed the Secondary School Leaving
Certificate examination or equivalent examination, the age and date of birth of State Servant
shall be accepted on the basis of entries in regard to the date of birth in the Secondary School
Leaving Certificate of any other examination equivalent thereto which is also accepted as the
proof of age for the purposes of recruitment.
Hence the Bill.
(Published in the Karnataka Gazette(Extraordinary) PartIV-2A No.215, dated 19-3-1982,
at page 3.)
IV
Amending Act 13 of 1984.- According to sub-section (2) of section 3 of the Karnataka
State Servants(Determination of Age) Act, 1974 the power to determine the age and date of birth
of a State Servant on his entry into the State Civil Services vests in the appointing authority. In
relation to the members of the judicial Services including munsiffs the appointing authority is the
Governor. Accordingly the age and date of birth of persons appointed as Munsiffs are being
determined with the approval of the Governor.
In view of the ruling given by the Supreme Court, reported in AIR 1981 SC 561 (B.S.
Yadav Vs. State of Harayana) though the Legislature or the Governor has the power to regulate
the conditions of service of judicial officers for laying down rules of general application, the
High Court is the authority to regulate the conditions of the service of each judicial officer and in
the light of this ruling the power to determine the age and date of birth of judicial officer falls
within the jurisdiction of the High Court. It is, therefore, considered necessary to amend section
3 of the said Act suitably.
Hence the Bill.

Principal Act 20 of 19s9.-Article 320 ol the Constitution of
lndia, specif ies the Iunctions of the Public Service Commission
and Article 321 empowers the State Legislature by an enactment
to provide for exercise ol additional lunctions by the Public
Service Commission as respects the services of the State and
also as respects the services of any local ar-rthority or other body
corporate corrstituted by law or ol any public instilution. ln order
to ensure that proper persons are appointed to the services of
local authorities it is considered necessary to entrust the Public
Service Commission with the same functions as it exercises as
respects lhe services ol the State.
It is also considered necessary to entrust the Cornmission
with the {unction of conducting the departmental examinations
which Governrnent servanls are required to pass either to secure
confirmatiorr or promotion. The procedure to be {ollowed by the
Commission in the perlormance of its runctions has also to be
regulated by an enactment. Hence the Bill.-Obtained lrom
Notification No. 1014 LC, dated 30.10.1958.
il
Amending Act 25 of 1966.-According 10 section 11 ol the
Mysore Public Service Commission (Conduct of Business and
Additional Fr"rnctions) Act, 1959, the communications from the
l
Commission have to be signed by the Secretary. ln view of the
increase of work ol the Commission it is considered necessary
to empower the Assistant Secretary also to sign
communications. lt is also considered necessary to have a
specifrc provision for obtaining returns, records and inlormation
Irom the Commission. Hence the Bill.-Karnataka Gazette
Extraordinary, dated 1 1th July 1 966, PART lV-2-A, No. 1 1 8, p.

Amending Act 23 of 1973.-Under section ol the Act the
quorum Ior a nreeting ol Public Service Commission is two. This
was fixed when there were only three members in the
Commission. lhe number of members has since been raised
to seven. ln view of this quorum requires to be re-lixed at rour.
Under section 16 ol ttrc Act, the Public Service Commission
is required to hold service examinations only Ior Government
servants. Some of the local authorities and statuiory bodies have
prescribed the same examinations as those prescribed for
Government servanls for their employees and ihey have
requested that their enrployees may also be made eligible to
appear for the service examinations conducted by lhe Public
Service Commissiorr. lt is, therefore, proposed to am( 'rd seclion

Hence the Bill.-Karnataka Gazette Extraordinary, ated 30th
August 1 973, PART lV-2-A, No. 689, p. 3.
IV
Amending Act 21 of 1978.-The name of the tate was
changed irom Mysore to Karnataka with effect from 1 1 1-1 973.
By the l(arnataka Adaptation of Laws Order, 973 the word
1
"Mysore" occurring in various enactments, rules and n(, ilications,
then in force was substituted wherever necessary b' the word
"Karnataka". ln the Acts specilied in Schedule I introdu red in the
Legislature earlier to 1st November, 1973 but ublished
1t9e- ?-
lherea{ter the word "Mysore" continue to exist. Therefore it is
proposed to make lhe necessary consequential amendments to
the said Acts also.

posts;
(b) The seniority inter-se of officers who are confirmed shall be determined according to

same, their relative seniority will be determined by-their seniority inter-se while
